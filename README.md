# Reminder Bot

This project provides some basic infrastructure for writing a FB messenger bot in go.

To run your own messenger bot, you will need to create a config.go file that contains your FB messenger bot's Verify Token and Page Access Token as constants.
```
package main

const VerifyToken = [insert]
const PageAccessToken = [insert]
```
